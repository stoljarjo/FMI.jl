## Motivation
This Julia Package *FMI.jl* is motivated by the use of simulation models in Julia. Here the FMI specification is implemented. FMI (*Functional Mock-up Interface*) is a free standard ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)) that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file. The user can thus use simulation models in the form of an FMU (*Functional Mock-up Units*). Besides loading the FMU, the user can also set values for parameters and states and simulate the FMU both as co-simulation and model exchange simulation.

## Introduction to the example
This example shows how to parallelize the computation of an FMU in FMI.jl. We can compute a batch of FMU-evaluations in parallel with different initial settings.
Parallelization can be achieved using multithreading or using multiprocessing. This example shows **multithreading**, check `multiprocessing.ipynb` for multiprocessing.
Advantage of multithreading is a lower communication overhead as well as lower RAM usage.
However in some cases multiprocessing can be faster as the garbage collector is not shared.


The model used is a one-dimensional spring pendulum with friction. The object-orientated structure of the *SpringFrictionPendulum1D* can be seen in the following graphic.

## Target group
The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of simulations. The example wants to show how simple it is to use FMUs in Julia.


## Other formats
Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/multithreading.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/multithreading.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells and for the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/multithreading.md) corresponding to the notebook.

## Code section

To run the example, the previously installed packages must be included. 


```julia
# imports
using FMI
using FMIZoo
using Folds
using BenchmarkTools
```

First, check the amount of available threads:


```julia
Threads.nthreads()
```




    1



If the number of available threads doesn't match your expections, you can increase the number of threads available to the Julia process like described [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/#Starting-Julia-with-multiple-threads).

### Simulation setup

Next, the start time and end time of the simulation are set. Here we also decide the size of the batch.


```julia
t_start = 0.0
t_step = 0.1
t_stop = 10.0
tspan = (t_start, t_stop)
tData = collect(t_start:t_step:t_stop)

# Best if batchSize is a multiple of the threads/cores
batchSize = Threads.nthreads()

# Define an array of arrays randomly
input_values = collect(collect.(eachrow(rand(batchSize,2))))

```




    1-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
     [0.9742327256813584, 0.6057958448721475]



We need to instantiate one FMU for each parallel execution, as they cannot be easily shared among different threads.


```julia
# a single FMU to compare the performance
realFMU = fmiLoad("SpringPendulum1D", "Dymola", "2022x")

# the FMU batch
realFMUBatch = [fmiLoad("SpringPendulum1D", "Dymola", "2022x") for _ in 1:batchSize]
```




    1-element Vector{FMU2}:
     Model name:        SpringPendulum1D
    Type:              1



We define a helper function to calculate the FMU solution and combine it into an Matrix.


```julia
function runCalcFormatted(fmu::FMU2, x0::Vector{Float64}, recordValues::Vector{String}=["mass.s", "mass.v"])
    data = fmiSimulateME(fmu, tspan; recordValues=recordValues, saveat=tData, x0=x0, showProgress=false, dtmax=1e-4)
    return reduce(hcat, data.states.u)
end
```




    runCalcFormatted (generic function with 2 methods)



Running a single evaluation is pretty quick, therefore the speed can be better tested with BenchmarkTools.


```julia
@benchmark data = runCalcFormatted(realFMU, rand(2))
```

### Single Threaded Batch Execution
To compute a batch we can collect multiple evaluations. In a single threaded context we can use the same FMU for every call.


```julia
println("Single Threaded")
@benchmark collect(runCalcFormatted(realFMU, i) for i in input_values)
```

### Multithreaded Batch Execution
In a multithreaded context we have to provide each thread it's own fmu, as they are not thread safe.
To spread the execution of a function to multiple threads, the library `Folds` can be used.


```julia
println("Multi Threaded")
@benchmark Folds.collect(runCalcFormatted(fmu, i) for (fmu, i) in zip(realFMUBatch, input_values))
```

As you can see, there is a significant speed-up in the median execution time. But: The speed-up is often much smaller than `Threads.nthreads()`, this has different reasons. For a rule of thumb, the speed-up should be around `n/2` on a `n`-core-processor with `n` threads for the Julia process.

### Unload FMU

After calculating the data, the FMU is unloaded and all unpacked data on disc is removed.


```julia
fmiUnload(realFMU)
fmiUnload.(realFMUBatch)
```




    1-element Vector{Nothing}:
     nothing



### Summary

In this tutorial it is shown how multi threading with `Folds.jl` can be used to improve the performance for calculating a Batch of FMUs.
